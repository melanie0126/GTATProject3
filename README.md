## Visualization Project Topic: Visualizing Trends between Broad Economic Data and S&P Sectors ##
Project Description: This project focuses on four key time series economic datasets maintained by the Federal Reserve compared with the performance of the S&P 500 (eleven individual sectors and the sector considered as a whole) from year 2000.
Data: The two datasets to create the visuals came from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/fred-addin/ for the Federal Reserve portion and https://finance.yahoo.com/ for the S&P sector portion. This data was housed in SQLite with the visuals created using d3 & JavaScript including the jQuery library.
Webpage Access: Once you store the repository locally, simply navigate to the “Melanie” folder and python app.py from your terminal.
